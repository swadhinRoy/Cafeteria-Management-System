   <pre><h1><br><font color="white">self-service restaurant in which customers select various dishes
 from an open-counter display. 
The food is usually placed on a tray,
 paid for at a cashier’s station, and carried to a dining table by the customer. 
The modern cafeteria, designed to facilitate a smooth flow of patrons,
 is particularly well-adapted to the needs of institutions—schools,
 hospitals, corporations—attempting to serve large numbers of people 
efficiently and inexpensively.
 In addition to providing quick service, the cafeteria
 requires fewer service personnel than most other commercial
 eating establishments.</font>
