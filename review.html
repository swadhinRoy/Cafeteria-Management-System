If you’re looking for a particular restaurant, try entering its 
name as well as your city into a search engine.
 There are a number of duplicate restaurant 
names nationwide, so specifying 
your city can help you find the right restaurant.
A restaurant's site is typically going to show 
you only positive information
 and reviews, so use independent restaurant review 
sites to find unbiased opinions.
If you have a spectacular (or spectacularly disappointing) experience with 
a restaurant, post a review of your own on
 the restaurant review site of your choice.
 This is especially valuable if your experience was contrary to 
the opinions that you'd read about the restaurant.</font>
